# riff-knative-demo
This is a walkthrough of the Riff on Knative (PFS) demo at the SpringOne Platform 2018 Pivotal demo booth. You can view a recording of this demo here: [insert link] 

<h3>Setup</h3>
Here is the recommended window layout for running the demo: 2 terminal windows on the left, and a browser window on the right. The top terminal window is for running commands, the bottom is for viewing live container logs. The browser window should open to http://s1p-weave.corby.cc, where you will see a weavescope visualization of our Kubernetes cluster. Select the "Pods" view from the top-level menu of weave.
